An objective function is either a loss function or its negative (in specific domains, variously called a reward function, a profit function, a utility function, a fitness function, etc. In statistics and decision theory, a frequently used loss function is the 0-1 loss function where I {\displaystyle I} is the indicator function. But for risk-averse (or risk-loving) agents, loss is measured as the negative of a utility function, and the objective function to be optimized is the expected value of utility. Both frequentist and Bayesian statistical theory involve making a decision based on the expected value of the loss function; however, this quantity is defined differently under the two paradigms. The use of a quadratic loss function is common, for example when using least squares techniques. The quadratic loss function is also used in linear-quadratic optimal control problems. In some contexts, the value of the loss function itself is a random quantity because it depends on the outcome of a random variable X.
